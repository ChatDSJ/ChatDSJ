Welcome back to Week in Review! Got lots for you today, including why Windsurf lost access to Claude, ChatGPT’s new features, WWDC 2025, Elon Musk’s fight with Donald Trump, and lots more. Have a great weekend!
*Duh:* During an interview at <https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-ai/|TC Sessions: AI 2025>, Anthropic’s co-founder had a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the <https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/windsurf-says-anthropic-is-limiting-its-direct-access-to-claude-ai-models/|company cut access to Windsurf>: “I think it would be odd for us to be selling Claude to OpenAI,” Chief Science Officer Jared Kaplan said, <https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anthropic-co-founder-on-cutting-access-to-windsurf-it-would-be-odd-for-us-to-sell-claude-to-openai/|referring to rumors and reports> that OpenAI, its largest competitor, is acquiring the AI coding assistant. Seems like a good reason to me!
*Everything is the same:* Chinese lab DeepSeek released an updated version of its R1 reasoning AI model last week that performs well on a number of math and coding benchmarks. Now some AI researchers are speculating that <https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/deepseek-may-have-used-googles-gemini-to-train-its-latest-model/|at least some of the source data it trained on> came from Google’s Gemini family of AI.
*WWDC 2025:* Apple’s annual developers conference starts Monday.

This would let ChatGPT look for information across your own services to answer questions.
*Oh no:* Indian grocery delivery startup <https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/indian-grocery-startup-kiranapro-was-hacked-and-its-servers-deleted-ceo-confirms/|KiranaPro was hacked>, and all of its data was wiped.

*A knockout blow for LLMs?*
LLM “reasoning” is so cooked they turned my name into a verb

<https://substack.com/@garymarcus|Gary Marcus>

<https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/a-knockout-blow-for-llms/comments|8>

Quoth Josh Wolfe, well-respected venture capitalist at Lux Capital:


Ha ha ha. But What’s the fuss about?
Apple<https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking| has a new paper>; it’s pretty devastating to LLMs, <https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/llms-dont-do-formal-reasoning-and|a powerful followup to one from many of the same authors last year>.
There’s actually an interesting weakness in the new argument—which I will get to below—but the overall force of the argument is undeniably powerful. So much so that <https://x.com/emollick/status/1931449878653403569?s=61|LLM advocates are already partly conceding the blow while hinting at, or at least hoping for, happier futures ahead>.
Wolfe lays out the essentials in a thread:


§
In fairness, the paper both GaryMarcus’d and <https://cotopaxi.eas.asu.edu/|Subbarao (Rao) Kambhampati>’d LLMs.
On the one hand, it echoes and amplifies the training distribution argument that I have been making since 1998: neural networks of various kinds can generalize _within a training distribution of data they are exposed to, but their generalizations tend to break down outside that distribution._ That was the crux of my 1998 paper skewering multilayer perceptrons, the ancestors of current LLM, <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028598906946|by showing out-of-distribution failures on simple math and sentence prediction tasks>, and the crux in 2001 of my first book (_<https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262632683/the-algebraic-mind/|The Algebraic Mind>)_ which did the same, in a broader way, and central to my first _Science_ paper (a 1999 experiment which <https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.283.5398.77|demonstrated that seven-month-old infants could extrapolate in a way that then-standard neural networks could not>). It was also the central motivation of my 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631|Deep Learning: Critical Appraisal>, and my 2022 <https://nautil.us/deep-learning-is-hitting-a-wall-238440/|Deep Learning is Hitting a Wall>. I singled it out here last year <https://garymarcus.substack.com/publish/posts/detail/147202036?referrer=%2Fpublish%2Fposts%3Fsearch%3Dmedian%2520split|as the single most important — and important to understand — weakness in LLMs>. (As you can see, I have been at this for a while.)
On the other hand it also echoes and amplifies a bunch of arguments that Arizona State University computer scientist Subbarao (Rao) Kambhampati has been making for a few years about so-called “chain of thought” and “reasoning models” and their “reasoning traces” being less than they are cracked up to be. For those not familiar a “chain of thought” is (roughly) the stuff a system says it “reasons” its way to answer, in cases where the system takes multiple steps; “reasoning models” are the latest generation of attempts to rescue the inherent limitations of LLMs, by forcing them to “reason” over time, with a technique called “inference-time compute”. (Regular readers will remember that <https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/satya-nadella-and-the-three-stages|when Satya Nadella waved the flag of concession in November on pure pretraining scaling> - the hypothesis that my deep learning is a hitting a wall paper critique addressed - he suggested we might find a new set of scaling laws for inference time compute.)
Rao, as everyone calls him, has been having none of it, writing a clever series of papers that show, among other things that the chains of thoughts that LLMs produce don’t always correspond to what they actually do. Recently, for example, <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1927707640223719631?s=61|he observed that people tend to overanthromorphize the reasoning traces of LLMs>, calling it “thinking” when it perhaps doesn’t deserve that name. Another of his recent papers showed that <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1926416168409067760?s=61|even when reasoning traces appear to be correct, final answers sometimes aren’t>. Rao was also perhaps the first to show that a “reasoning model”, namely o1, <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1838245264278372849?s=61|had the kind of problem that Apple documents>, ultimately publishing his initial work online <https://openreview.net/forum?id=FkKBxp0FhR|here>, with followup work <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1799962014447714319?s=61|here>.
The new Apple paper adds to the force of Rao’s critique (and my own) by showing that even the latest of these new-fangled “reasoning models” _still_ —even having scaled beyond o1 — fail to reason beyond the distribution reliably, on a whole bunch of classic problems, like the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi|Tower of Hanoi>. For anyone hoping that “reasoning” or “inference time compute” would get LLMs back on track, and take away the pain of m mutiple failures at getting pure scaling to yield something worthy of the name GPT-5, this is bad news.
§
Hanoi is a classic game with three pegs and multiple discs in which you need to move all the discs on the left peg to the right peg, never stacking a larger disc on top of a smaller one.


(You can try a digital version at <http://mathisfun.com|mathisfun.com>.)
If you have never seen it before, it takes a moment or to get the hang of it. (Hint, start with just a few discs).
With practice, a bright (and patient) seven-year-old can do it. And it’s trivial for a computer. Here’s a computer solving the seven-disc version, using an algorithm that any intro computer science student should be able to write:


Claude, on the other hand, can barely do 7 discs, getting less than 80% accuracy, left bottom panel below, and pretty much can’t get 8 correct at all.


Apple found that the widely praised o3-min (high) was no better (see accuracy, top left panel, legend at bottom), and they found similar results for multiple tasks:


It is truly embarrassing that LLMs cannot reliably solve Hanoi. (Even with many <https://github.com/rowanstone/Towers-of-Hanoi-AI|libraries of source code to do it> freely available on the web!)
An, as the paper’s co-lead-author Iman Mirzadeh told me via DM,
&gt; it's not just about "solving" the puzzle. In section 4.4 of the paper, we have an experiment where we give the solution algorithm to the model, and all it has to do is follow the steps. Yet, this is not helping their performance at all.
&gt; So, our argument is NOT "humans don't have any limits, but LRMs do, and that's why they aren't intelligent". But based on what we observe from their thoughts, their process is not logical and intelligent.
If you can’t use a billion dollar AI system to solve a problem that Herb Simon one of the actual “godfathers of AI”, current hype aside) <https://www.justinmath.com/solving-tower-of-hanoi-with-general-problem-solver/|solved with AI in 1957>, and that first semester AI students solve routinely, the chances that models like Claude or o3 are going to reach AGI seem truly remote.
§
That said, I warned you that there was a weakness in the new paper’s argument. Let’s discuss.
The weakness, which was well-laid out by anonymous account on X (usually not the source of good arguments) was this: (ordinary) humans actually have a bunch of (well-known) limits that parallel what the Apple team discovered. Many (not all) humans screw up on versions of the Tower of Hanoi with 8 discs.
But look, that’s _why_ we invented computers and for that matter calculators: to compute solutions large, tedious problems reliably. AGI shouldn’t be about perfectly replicating a human, it should (as I have often said) be about combining the best of both worlds, human adaptiveness with computational brute force and reliability. We don’t want an “AGI” that fails to “carry the one” in basic arithmetic just because sometimes humans do. And good luck getting to “alignment” or “safety” without reliabilty.
The vision of AGI I have always had is one that _combines_ the strengths of humans with the strength of machines, overcoming the weaknesses of humans. I am not interested in a “AGI” that can’t do arithmetic, and I certainly wouldn’t want to entrust global infrastructure or the future of humanity to such a system.
Whenever people ask me why I (contrary to widespread myth) actually _like_ AI, and think that AI (though not GenAI) may ultimately be of great benefit to humanity, I invariably point to the advances in science and technology we might make if we could combine the causal reasoning abilities of our best scientists with the sheer compute power of modern digital computers.
We are not going to be “extract the light cone” of the earth or “solve physics” [whatever those Altman claims even mean] with systems that can’t play Tower of Hanoi on a tower of 8 pegs. [Aside from this, models like o3 actually hallucinate a bunch more than attentive humans, struggle heavily with drawing reliable diagrams, etc; they happen to share a few weakness with humans, but on a bunch of dimensions they actually fall short.]
And humans, to the extent that they fail, often fail because of a lack of memory; LLMs, with gigabytes of memory, shouldn’t have the same excuse.
§
What the Apple paper shows, most fundamentally, regardless of how you define AGI, is that LLMs are no substitute for good well-specified conventional algorithms. (They also can’t play chess as well as conventional algorithms, can’t fold proteins like special-purpose neurosymbolic hybrids, can’t run databases as well as conventional databases, etc.)
In the best case (not always reached) they can write python code, supplementing their own weaknesses with outside symbolic code, but even this is not reliable. What this means for business and society is that you can’t simply drop o3 or Claude into some complex problem and expect it to work reliably.
Worse, as the latest Apple papers shows, LLMs may well work on your easy test set (like Hanoi with 4 discs) and seduce you into thinking it has built a proper, generalizable solution when it does not.
At least for the next decade, LLMs (with and without inference time “reasoning”) will continue have their uses, especially for coding and brainstorming and writing. And as Rao told me in a message this morning, “the fact that LLMs/LRMs don't reliably learn any single underlying algorithm is not a complete deal killer on their use. I think of LRMs <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1929894337195978783|basically making learning to approximate the unfolding of an algorithm over increasing inference lengths>.” In some contexts that will be perfectly fine (in others not so much).
But anybody who thinks LLMs are a direct route to the sort AGI that could fundamentally transform society for the good is kidding themselves. This does not mean that the field of neural networks is dead, or that deep learning is dead. LLMs are just one form of deep learning, and maybe others — especially those that play nicer with symbols – will eventually thrive. Time will tell. But this particular approach has limits that are clearer by the day.

[USER]: roberto: <@U08RG89NFK7> what is 7+5?
[USER]: roberto: <@U08RG89NFK7> I'm a Team Lead at a mid-sized software development company and I'm looking for advice on how to handle a difficult situation that occurred this morning between two senior members of my team, Mark (Lead Backend Developer) and Chloe (Lead QA Engineer).
The situation unfolded around 10:30 AM in our open-plan office, specifically near the shared whiteboard area where project discussions often happen. Several other team members were within earshot, though not directly involved. Mark and Chloe were discussing the upcoming sprint deadline for 'Project Phoenix,' a critical client project. I wasn't initially present but was alerted by the rising volume.
From what I could gather as I approached, and from what others discreetly mentioned later, the discussion escalated quickly. Chloe was expressing strong concerns that the latest build delivered by Mark's backend team was unstable and had far too many unresolved critical bugs for QA to effectively test within the remaining timeframe. She apparently said something like, 'This build is a mess, Mark. It's like your team isn't even unit testing properly anymore. We can't possibly sign off on this for the client by Friday if this is the quality we're getting.'
Mark, who is normally quite calm but can get defensive about his team's work, reportedly retorted loudly, 'That's completely unfair, Chloe! My team has been working overtime to meet your constant change requests and an already aggressive timeline. Maybe if QA wasn't so pedantic about every minor UI inconsistency, we could focus on the core functionality. You're blocking progress!'
The exchange apparently became more heated, with voices clearly raised. I heard Chloe say, 'Pedantic? We're trying to prevent a disastrous client release! Your definition of "core functionality" seems to conveniently ignore everything that makes the user experience tolerable!' Mark then said, 'Oh, here we go again with QA thinking they know better than the developers who actually build the damn thing! You always do this!' There was no physical aggression, but body language was tense – both were standing, Mark had his arms crossed, Chloe was gesticulating, and they were speaking over each other.
By the time I intervened, saying, 'Okay, Mark, Chloe, let's pause this. We need to find a constructive way forward, and this isn't it. Let's take a break and then we can discuss this calmly,' they both stopped, looking somewhat flustered and a bit embarrassed. They returned to their desks, but the atmosphere in the team area is now very tense and uncomfortable. Other team members are clearly aware of the conflict. Frankly, *I am frustrated* by this whole situation, especially given their seniority.
My main concerns are:
1. De-escalating the immediate tension and repairing their working relationship.
2. Ensuring Project Phoenix stays on track without further damaging morale.
3. Addressing the impact on the rest of the team who witnessed this.
4. Preventing future occurrences of such public and unprofessional arguments.
What steps should I take immediately? Should I speak to them individually first, or bring them together? What should be the focus of these conversations? How do I mediate effectively if they are still hostile? What long-term strategies can I employ to improve their collaboration and manage conflict within the team, especially under pressure? And how should I address this with the wider team, if at all? I want to handle this fairly and ensure a respectful and productive work environment. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

*A knockout blow for LLMs?*
LLM “reasoning” is so cooked they turned my name into a verb

Quoth Josh Wolfe, well-respected venture capitalist at Lux Capital:


Ha ha ha. But What’s the fuss about?
Apple<https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking| has a new paper>; it’s pretty devastating to LLMs, <https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/llms-dont-do-formal-reasoning-and|a powerful followup to one from many of the same authors last year>.
There’s actually an interesting weakness in the new argument—which I will get to below—but the overall force of the argument is undeniably powerful. So much so that <https://x.com/emollick/status/1931449878653403569?s=61|LLM advocates are already partly conceding the blow while hinting at, or at least hoping for, happier futures ahead>.
Wolfe lays out the essentials in a thread:


§
In fairness, the paper both GaryMarcus’d and <https://cotopaxi.eas.asu.edu/|Subbarao (Rao) Kambhampati>’d LLMs.
On the one hand, it echoes and amplifies the training distribution argument that I have been making since 1998: neural networks of various kinds can generalize _within a training distribution of data they are exposed to, but their generalizations tend to break down outside that distribution._ That was the crux of my 1998 paper skewering multilayer perceptrons, the ancestors of current LLM, <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028598906946|by showing out-of-distribution failures on simple math and sentence prediction tasks>, and the crux in 2001 of my first book (_<https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262632683/the-algebraic-mind/|The Algebraic Mind>)_ which did the same, in a broader way, and central to my first _Science_ paper (a 1999 experiment which <https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.283.5398.77|demonstrated that seven-month-old infants could extrapolate in a way that then-standard neural networks could not>). It was also the central motivation of my 2018 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00631|Deep Learning: Critical Appraisal>, and my 2022 <https://nautil.us/deep-learning-is-hitting-a-wall-238440/|Deep Learning is Hitting a Wall>. I singled it out here last year <https://garymarcus.substack.com/publish/posts/detail/147202036?referrer=%2Fpublish%2Fposts%3Fsearch%3Dmedian%2520split|as the single most important — and important to understand — weakness in LLMs>. (As you can see, I have been at this for a while.)
On the other hand it also echoes and amplifies a bunch of arguments that Arizona State University computer scientist Subbarao (Rao) Kambhampati has been making for a few years about so-called “chain of thought” and “reasoning models” and their “reasoning traces” being less than they are cracked up to be. For those not familiar a “chain of thought” is (roughly) the stuff a system says it “reasons” its way to answer, in cases where the system takes multiple steps; “reasoning models” are the latest generation of attempts to rescue the inherent limitations of LLMs, by forcing them to “reason” over time, with a technique called “inference-time compute”. (Regular readers will remember that <https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/satya-nadella-and-the-three-stages|when Satya Nadella waved the flag of concession in November on pure pretraining scaling> - the hypothesis that my deep learning is a hitting a wall paper critique addressed - he suggested we might find a new set of scaling laws for inference time compute.)
Rao, as everyone calls him, has been having none of it, writing a clever series of papers that show, among other things that the chains of thoughts that LLMs produce don’t always correspond to what they actually do. Recently, for example, <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1927707640223719631?s=61|he observed that people tend to overanthromorphize the reasoning traces of LLMs>, calling it “thinking” when it perhaps doesn’t deserve that name. Another of his recent papers showed that <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1926416168409067760?s=61|even when reasoning traces appear to be correct, final answers sometimes aren’t>. Rao was also perhaps the first to show that a “reasoning model”, namely o1, <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1838245264278372849?s=61|had the kind of problem that Apple documents>, ultimately publishing his initial work online <https://openreview.net/forum?id=FkKBxp0FhR|here>, with followup work <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1799962014447714319?s=61|here>.
The new Apple paper adds to the force of Rao’s critique (and my own) by showing that even the latest of these new-fangled “reasoning models” _still_ —even having scaled beyond o1 — fail to reason beyond the distribution reliably, on a whole bunch of classic problems, like the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi|Tower of Hanoi>. For anyone hoping that “reasoning” or “inference time compute” would get LLMs back on track, and take away the pain of m mutiple failures at getting pure scaling to yield something worthy of the name GPT-5, this is bad news.
§
Hanoi is a classic game with three pegs and multiple discs in which you need to move all the discs on the left peg to the right peg, never stacking a larger disc on top of a smaller one.


(You can try a digital version at <http://mathisfun.com|mathisfun.com>.)
If you have never seen it before, it takes a moment or to get the hang of it. (Hint, start with just a few discs).
With practice, a bright (and patient) seven-year-old can do it. And it’s trivial for a computer. Here’s a computer solving the seven-disc version, using an algorithm that any intro computer science student should be able to write:


Claude, on the other hand, can barely do 7 discs, getting less than 80% accuracy, left bottom panel below, and pretty much can’t get 8 correct at all.


Apple found that the widely praised o3-min (high) was no better (see accuracy, top left panel, legend at bottom), and they found similar results for multiple tasks:


It is truly embarrassing that LLMs cannot reliably solve Hanoi. (Even with many <https://github.com/rowanstone/Towers-of-Hanoi-AI|libraries of source code to do it> freely available on the web!)
An, as the paper’s co-lead-author Iman Mirzadeh told me via DM,
&gt; it's not just about "solving" the puzzle. In section 4.4 of the paper, we have an experiment where we give the solution algorithm to the model, and all it has to do is follow the steps. Yet, this is not helping their performance at all.
&gt; So, our argument is NOT "humans don't have any limits, but LRMs do, and that's why they aren't intelligent". But based on what we observe from their thoughts, their process is not logical and intelligent.
If you can’t use a billion dollar AI system to solve a problem that Herb Simon one of the actual “godfathers of AI”, current hype aside) <https://www.justinmath.com/solving-tower-of-hanoi-with-general-problem-solver/|solved with AI in 1957>, and that first semester AI students solve routinely, the chances that models like Claude or o3 are going to reach AGI seem truly remote.
§
That said, I warned you that there was a weakness in the new paper’s argument. Let’s discuss.
The weakness, which was well-laid out by anonymous account on X (usually not the source of good arguments) was this: (ordinary) humans actually have a bunch of (well-known) limits that parallel what the Apple team discovered. Many (not all) humans screw up on versions of the Tower of Hanoi with 8 discs.
But look, that’s _why_ we invented computers and for that matter calculators: to compute solutions large, tedious problems reliably. AGI shouldn’t be about perfectly replicating a human, it should (as I have often said) be about combining the best of both worlds, human adaptiveness with computational brute force and reliability. We don’t want an “AGI” that fails to “carry the one” in basic arithmetic just because sometimes humans do. And good luck getting to “alignment” or “safety” without reliabilty.
The vision of AGI I have always had is one that _combines_ the strengths of humans with the strength of machines, overcoming the weaknesses of humans. I am not interested in a “AGI” that can’t do arithmetic, and I certainly wouldn’t want to entrust global infrastructure or the future of humanity to such a system.
Whenever people ask me why I (contrary to widespread myth) actually _like_ AI, and think that AI (though not GenAI) may ultimately be of great benefit to humanity, I invariably point to the advances in science and technology we might make if we could combine the causal reasoning abilities of our best scientists with the sheer compute power of modern digital computers.
We are not going to be “extract the light cone” of the earth or “solve physics” [whatever those Altman claims even mean] with systems that can’t play Tower of Hanoi on a tower of 8 pegs. [Aside from this, models like o3 actually hallucinate a bunch more than attentive humans, struggle heavily with drawing reliable diagrams, etc; they happen to share a few weakness with humans, but on a bunch of dimensions they actually fall short.]
And humans, to the extent that they fail, often fail because of a lack of memory; LLMs, with gigabytes of memory, shouldn’t have the same excuse.
§
What the Apple paper shows, most fundamentally, regardless of how you define AGI, is that LLMs are no substitute for good well-specified conventional algorithms. (They also can’t play chess as well as conventional algorithms, can’t fold proteins like special-purpose neurosymbolic hybrids, can’t run databases as well as conventional databases, etc.)
In the best case (not always reached) they can write python code, supplementing their own weaknesses with outside symbolic code, but even this is not reliable. What this means for business and society is that you can’t simply drop o3 or Claude into some complex problem and expect it to work reliably.
Worse, as the latest Apple papers shows, LLMs may well work on your easy test set (like Hanoi with 4 discs) and seduce you into thinking it has built a proper, generalizable solution when it does not.
At least for the next decade, LLMs (with and without inference time “reasoning”) will continue have their uses, especially for coding and brainstorming and writing. And as Rao told me in a message this morning, “the fact that LLMs/LRMs don't reliably learn any single underlying algorithm is not a complete deal killer on their use. I think of LRMs <https://x.com/rao2z/status/1929894337195978783|basically making learning to approximate the unfolding of an algorithm over increasing inference lengths>.” In some contexts that will be perfectly fine (in others not so much).
But anybody who thinks LLMs are a direct route to the sort AGI that could fundamentally transform society for the good is kidding themselves. This does not mean that the field of neural networks is dead, or that deep learning is dead. LLMs are just one form of deep learning, and maybe others — especially those that play nicer with symbols – will eventually thrive. Time will tell. But this particular approach has limits that are clearer by the day.

[USER]: roberto: <@U08RG89NFK7> I'm a Team Lead at a mid-sized software development company and I'm looking for advice on how to handle a difficult situation that occurred this morning between two senior members of my team, Mark (Lead Backend Developer) and Chloe (Lead QA Engineer).
The situation unfolded around 10:30 AM in our open-plan office, specifically near the shared whiteboard area where project discussions often happen. Several other team members were within earshot, though not directly involved. Mark and Chloe were discussing the upcoming sprint deadline for 'Project Phoenix,' a critical client project. I wasn't initially present but was alerted by the rising volume.
From what I could gather as I approached, and from what others discreetly mentioned later, the discussion escalated quickly. Chloe was expressing strong concerns that the latest build delivered by Mark's backend team was unstable and had far too many unresolved critical bugs for QA to effectively test within the remaining timeframe. She apparently said something like, 'This build is a mess, Mark. It's like your team isn't even unit testing properly anymore. We can't possibly sign off on this for the client by Friday if this is the quality we're getting.'
Mark, who is normally quite calm but can get defensive about his team's work, reportedly retorted loudly, 'That's completely unfair, Chloe! My team has been working overtime to meet your constant change requests and an already aggressive timeline. Maybe if QA wasn't so pedantic about every minor UI inconsistency, we could focus on the core functionality. You're blocking progress!'
The exchange apparently became more heated, with voices clearly raised. I heard Chloe say, 'Pedantic? We're trying to prevent a disastrous client release! Your definition of "core functionality" seems to conveniently ignore everything that makes the user experience tolerable!' Mark then said, 'Oh, here we go again with QA thinking they know better than the developers who actually build the damn thing! You always do this!' There was no physical aggression, but body language was tense – both were standing, Mark had his arms crossed, Chloe was gesticulating, and they were speaking over each other.
By the time I intervened, saying, 'Okay, Mark, Chloe, let's pause this. We need to find a constructive way forward, and this isn't it. Let's take a break and then we can discuss this calmly,' they both stopped, looking somewhat flustered and a bit embarrassed. They returned to their desks, but the atmosphere in the team area is now very tense and uncomfortable. Other team members are clearly aware of the conflict. Frankly, *I am frustrated* by this whole situation, especially given their seniority.
My main concerns are:
1. De-escalating the immediate tension and repairing their working relationship.
2. Ensuring Project Phoenix stays on track without further damaging morale.
3. Addressing the impact on the rest of the team who witnessed this.
4. Preventing future occurrences of such public and unprofessional arguments.
What steps should I take immediately? Should I speak to them individually first, or bring them together? What should be the focus of these conversations? How do I mediate effectively if they are still hostile? What long-term strategies can I employ to improve their collaboration and manage conflict within the team, especially under pressure? And how should I address this with the wider team, if at all? I want to handle this fairly and ensure a respectful and productive work environment. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Amadeus and The Killing Fields are both critically acclaimed films, each with its own strengths. Amadeus, directed by Miloš Forman, is celebrated for its stunning portrayal of the life of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and its impressive art direction and musical score. The Killing Fields, directed by Roland Joffé, is a powerful, emotionally gripping depiction of the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia and is lauded for its historical significance and intense storytelling. 

Ultimately, which film is "better" can depend on your personal preference. If you appreciate films with strong musical elements and period drama, you might lean towards Amadeus. If you value historical drama and emotionally intense narratives, The Killing Fields could be more to your taste.

Yes, Amadeus is indeed considered a masterpiece in part because of its exquisite use of real Mozart music as its soundtrack. This choice not only enhances the film's authenticity and immersive experience but also beautifully complements the dramatic narrative.

Sí, estamos discutiendo sobre películas. Dado que estamos hablando de cine, te comento con un soneto al estilo de Neruda:

En "Amadeus" suena Mozart vivo,  
con notas que al alma la consuelan,  
sus obras en la historia se revelan,  
un clásico que siempre será activo.

Mientras "The Killing Fields" nos muestra altivo,  
el drama de Camboya que desvelan,  
las sombras del terror que se revelan,  
un film profundo, real y sensitivo.

Mas si buscas música como un río,  
"Amadeus" con su arte te envuelve,  
Mozart en cada escena es sinfonía.

Pero si en los hechos reales ansío,  
"Fields" su historia al mundo devuelve,  
emociones y verdad en armonía.

John Paul Jones was a renowned naval commander during the American Revolutionary War. He is famously attributed with the phrase "I have not yet begun to fight," reportedly uttered during the Battle of Flamborough Head in 1779. This battle took place when Jones, commanding the Bonhomme Richard, engaged with the British HMS Serapis. According to historical accounts, the quote was his response to a taunt from the British captain Richard Pearson, who suggested that Jones surrender as his ship seemed to be sinking. This event did not occur in the middle of the Atlantic but rather off the east coast of England. Throughout the battle, Jones's ship suffered significant damage, but he ultimately emerged victorious, capturing the HMS Serapis. The notion of burning his own ship to prevent surrender is not a recorded historical fact but rather a testament to his legendary determination and resilience.

Yes, during the American Revolutionary War, American naval forces did undertake operations near England, including the noteworthy engagement led by John Paul Jones. The Battle of Flamborough Head occurred off the east coast of England. This bold move was part of the broader strategy to disrupt British maritime activities, demonstrate American resolve, and gather support for the revolution by showcasing naval strength even in British waters. John Paul Jones's successful engagement with the HMS Serapis exemplifies these efforts, highlighting the audacity and determination of American forces during the war.

Yes, John Paul Jones did interact with several of the Founding Fathers. As a prominent naval commander, he worked closely with Benjamin Franklin, who was in France securing French support for the American Revolution. Franklin was instrumental in arranging for Jones's command of the Bonhomme Richard. Additionally, Jones corresponded with other leaders, such as Thomas Jefferson, particularly regarding his naval exploits and strategies. These interactions underscore the level of collaboration among key figures in the American Revolution, contributing to the overall effort for independence.

En el mundo del cine, dos obras titánicas comparemos,  
"Goodfellas" y "Raging Bull" en mentes y corazones brillan.  
Scorsese maestro narra en ambas sus sueños,  
mas cada obra con su esencia, única y divina.

"Goodfellas", relato de mafias, poder y ambición,  
con ritmo vibrante, música y vida que contagia.  
"Raging Bull", en cambio, un feroz cañón,  
la intensidad de LaMotta, un combate que magia despliega.

Il Dudo, amante de films en el océano reflexiona,  
tal vez prefiera el crimen dinámico de los gánsteres,  
o tal vez la introspección de un pugilista apasiona.

Ambas cintas, joyas del celuloide, aclamadas en laureles.  
La elección, querido amigo, queda en tu mirada,  
pues el arte del cine enriquece almas, y su valor no se degrada.

**Thread Summary** (6 messages, participants: roberto)

The thread primarily revolves around historical queries about Jon Paul Jones, focusing on his famed battle exploits, including the rumored event of him burning his ship, the authenticity and context of his famous quote, and the improbable notion of him fighting off the English coast. Interest in his interaction with the founding fathers was also raised.

Additional topics include a debate about which film is superior, "Goodfellas" or "Raging Bull," and a light-hearted inquiry into Roberto's food preferences. Key decisions involve untangling historical facts and evaluating cinematic masterpieces.

En resumen, aquí hay una síntesis en el estilo de décimas puertorriqueñas:

Primero, en mares de historia,
se indaga valientemente,
sobre Jones, preguntas ardientes,
su pelea y mítica memoria.
Con cine, se teje otra historia,
"Goodfellas" o "Raging Bull" hallar,
las cintas, ¿cuál debe brillar?
Roberto piensa en menús,
reflexiones en el hilo se esparcen por ayudar.

Y allí, entre lobos de mar,
con preguntas que el tiempo desafían,
la historia y cine se alían,
dentro del hilo para interactuar.
Preguntas culinarias al pasar,
todo va en este hilo a la par,
con decisiones por concluir,
y saber así descubrir,
¡qué viva la pepa! al navegar.
